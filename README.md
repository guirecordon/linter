## Usage

1. Run the line bellow in your terminal to clone this repo in your computer
    `git clone git@github.com:guirecordon/linter.git`

2. When you open the repo, you will see a txt file called user.txt.
   Remove the example text and paste your own text (email, essay, etc) into the body of the user.txt file 

3. From the command line, from the root directory (the main linter repo folder), run the following:
   `ruby bin/main.rb`

## Development

Glamourly is designed to help the user improve their writing skills. It encourages the consider expand their vocabulary usage.

I got the idea after I came across this vocabulary diagram I found on the web: 

<img src="images/increase_your_vocabulary_diagram.jpg">

The words inside of the innermost circle, I designated them as level 1 words. They should be avoided at all costs. The user is going to get a linter 'error' message if they try to use one of those.

The words in the middle circle, I designated them as being level 2 words. Because they are already more descriptive adjetives, instead of getting an 'error', the user is simply asked to consider replacing them by even more sophisticated options. These options are the word found in the outer layer in the diagram above.
At this point, the user is faced with a humorous linter message that suggests that the user(the writer in this case) might be trying to bore the reader to death by using lame adjetives. It is supposed to be humorous, no offense is intended.
